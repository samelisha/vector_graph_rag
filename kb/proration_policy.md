# Proration Policy

## Plan Upgrades
When upgrading from a lower plan to a higher plan, proration credits are automatically calculated and applied to the new invoice.

## Plan Downgrades
Downgrades usually take effect at the next renewal date and do not generate refunds for unused time unless required by law.

## Add-Ons
Add-ons purchased mid-cycle are prorated based on remaining time in the billing period.

## Billing Display
Prorated amounts are shown as credits or partial charges on the invoice.
