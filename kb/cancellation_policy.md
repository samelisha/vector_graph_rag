# Cancellation Policy

## How to Cancel
You can cancel your subscription from the Billing section of your account dashboard at any time before the renewal date.

## Effective Date
Cancellation is effective at the end of the current billing period unless otherwise stated during cancellation.

## Immediate Cancellation
In certain regions, users may opt for immediate cancellation. In such cases, access is terminated immediately and no further charges occur.

## Cancellation After Renewal
If cancellation occurs after renewal, the subscription remains active until the end of the current paid term unless a refund is granted based on the refund policy.

## Proof of Cancellation
An email confirmation is sent to the account email when cancellation is completed. This email serves as proof of cancellation.

## Administrative Cancellations
We reserve the right to cancel accounts that violate terms of service, with or without notice depending on severity.
