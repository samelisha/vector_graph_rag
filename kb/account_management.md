# Account Management

## Updating Email Address
The primary email address can be updated from Profile Settings. A verification email must be confirmed before the change takes effect.

## Deleting an Account
Account deletion permanently removes user data after a 30-day waiting period, except where longer retention is legally required.

## Reopening a Deleted Account
Once the deletion process is completed, reopening the account is not possible and data cannot be restored.

## Changing Plans
Plans can be upgraded or downgraded from the Billing section. Price changes take effect immediately for upgrades and at the next renewal for downgrades.

## Team Accounts
For team plans, only administrators may invite new members, assign roles, or modify billing details.
